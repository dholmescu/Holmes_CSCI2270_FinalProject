Final Project

Daniel Holmes.
For my final project I have created a political quiz. After prompted witha menu the user will answer a series of questions regarding policies in the United States. These questions are sourced from procon.org. The code then takes these answers along witht the importance as dictated by the user and compares five presidential canidates to one another. Upon reaching the end of the quiz the program will outout your top two selections, the issues which you agree with them most, and where you can read more information about your top canidate.
