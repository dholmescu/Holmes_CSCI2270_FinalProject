Final Project

Daniel Holmes.
For my final project I have created a political quiz. After prompted witha menu the user will answer a series of questions regarding policies in the United States. These questions are sourced from procon.org. The code then takes these answers along witht the importance as dictated by the user and compares five presidential canidates to one another. Upon reaching the end of the quiz the program will outout your top two selections, the issues which you agree with them most, and where you can read more information about your top canidate. In order to run just download and run the three main, src, and .h files, answer the questions and you will be given your results. 
Issues and Bugs
1. Making the code balenced for all candidates even when some have responded to more questions than others. 
2. If there is a tie in the code for comparing the final cadidate results then one cadidate has priority over the others.
3. Adding more links to visit after the results.
